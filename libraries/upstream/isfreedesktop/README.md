# IsFreedesktop

D programming language compile-time constant to test if target platform desktop environments usually follow freedesktop specifications.

I often need this kind of check myself in other projects. So following DRY practice, I decided to make this constant into library.

It contains nothing besides isFreedesktop constant.
